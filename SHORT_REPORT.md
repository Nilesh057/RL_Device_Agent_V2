# RL Device Agent v2 - Technical Report

## Overview
The RL Device Agent v2 is a production-ready reinforcement learning system that learns to control device operations through user feedback. This agent represents a significant advancement from prototype to deployable solution.

## Architecture & Components

### Core RL Engine (`rl_agent.py`)
- **Algorithm**: Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
- **State Representation**: Task intent + system context hashing
- **Confidence Scoring**: Normalized Q-value difference + experience weighting
- **Learning Parameters**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.1
  - Discount Factor: 0.9
  - Epsilon Decay: 0.995 (adaptive exploration)

### Logging System (`logger.py`)
Comprehensive multi-format logging with:
- **CSV Format**: Action-level logs with all required fields
- **SQLite Database**: Structured storage for complex queries
- **Real-time Metrics**: Episode tracking and performance monitoring
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV/JSON export for analysis

### Device Actions (`device_actions.py`)
Cross-platform device control supporting:
- **File Operations**: Browser, text editor, file management
- **Audio Control**: Mute/unmute, volume adjustment
- **System Operations**: Screenshots, system info, network status
- **Application Management**: Calculator, calendar, browser, settings
- **Window Management**: Minimize, maximize, switch, close operations

### User Feedback System (`feedback.py`)
Dual-interface feedback collection:
- **CLI Interface**: Direct terminal interaction with validation
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Web-based interface with visual feedback
- **Feedback Processing**: Real-time reward calculation and Q-table updates

### Visualization Engine (`visualizer.py`)
Advanced learning analytics:
- **Learning Curves**: Multi-metric progress tracking
- **Reward Distribution**: Statistical analysis and correlation plots
- **Action Analytics**: Frequency and success rate analysis
- **Timeline Analysis**: Feedback patterns over time

## Reward System

### Formula
```
Total Reward = Internal Reward + Feedback Reward + Confidence Bonus

Where:
- Internal Reward: ¬±1.0 to ¬±2.0 (based on execution success)
- Feedback Reward: +0.5 (üëç) or -0.5 (üëé)
- Confidence Bonus: Applied for high-confidence correct actions
```

### Reward Categories
1. **Execution Success**: +1.0 to +1.5 (complex actions get bonus)
2. **Execution Failure**: -1.0 to -2.0 (critical failures penalized more)
3. **User Feedback**: ¬±0.5 (immediate learning signal)
4. **Suggested Actions**: +1.0 boost when user provides correction

## Confidence Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_confidence(state, action):
    q_values = Q_table[state]
    
    # Method 1: Normalized Q-value position
    if max_q != min_q:
        q_confidence = (action_q - min_q) / (max_q - min_q)
    else:
        q_confidence = 0.5
    
    # Method 2: Experience factor
    experience_factor = min(action_count / 10.0, 1.0)
    
    # Combined confidence
    final_confidence = (q_confidence * 0.7) + (experience_factor * 0.3)
    
    return clamp(final_confidence, 0.0, 1.0)
```

## Persistence & Cumulative Learning

### Q-Table Storage
